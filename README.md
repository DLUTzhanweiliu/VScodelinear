# VScodelinear
I want to learn how to develop a package and write standard code.
The goal of this package is to speed up constrcting mixed integer linear programming model.
It aims to providing lots of methods to building the piecewise function of bivariate function.
I am not sure how long it will take me to finish it. To sum, I will try my best.
